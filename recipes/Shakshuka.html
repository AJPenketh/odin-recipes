    <h1>The origins of Shakshuka</h1>
        <p>Shakshuka is a dish that has its origins of North Africa, with many countries in that region having their own unique take on this classic dish.</p>
        <p>It is a vegetarian based dish usually made up of tomatoes, peppers, garlic and onions with eggs cracked into the mix. It is common to have Shakshuka served with bread or pita</p>

    <h2>Ingredients you will need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tsp ras el hanout</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
            <li>Can of chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/3 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 roasted red pepper, diced</li>
            <li>4-5 eggs</li>
            <li>Feta cheese</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>To prepare and cook:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a stainless steel pan, preheat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Once shimmering, add the diced onion and sweat the onions for 3 minutes over moderate heat. 
                    Once translucent and soft, add in 2-3 cloves of garlic and saute for an additional 30 seconds before adding 1 teaspoon of ras el hanout, and ½ teaspoon of whole cumin seeds. Toast the spices for about 30 seconds, and remove the pan from the heat if it starts to get too hot</li>
            <li>After toasting for 30 seconds or until very fragrant, add in a 28 ounce can of fire roasted tomatoes. If your tomatoes are whole, crush them up with a spoon in the pan. Bring that to a simmer and add ¼ teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika, and ½ cup of roasted red pepper.</li>
            <li>Once everything is added, bring it to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>After the sauce has thickened and small egg divots can be formed, use a spoon to form a well in the sauce and crack an egg inside each well. I usually make 4 or 5 eggs.</li>
            <li>Gently spoon the sauce up and around the whites of each egg to help them cook more evenly. Lower the heat, cover with the lid and let it gently simmer for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes make sure the whites of the eggs have set.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and begin dressing it up with a variety of toppings. I recommend some crumbled feta cheese, chopped parsley. Serve alongside some good bread.</li>
        </ol>
