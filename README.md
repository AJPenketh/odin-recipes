# odin-recipes
Web page to display my favourite recipes

This project is to demonstrate I have learnt and understood the basic html features taught in TheOdinProject and to practice my git commit messages.
The aim is to build a functioning website to record and list my most favourite recipes to make, with a video and detailed instructions.
I will attempt to recreate the page in spanish to self-teach myself how to toggle the page to a different language.

Checklist of features I want to implement:
Language Preference toggle
Nutrition Table
Contact Page
Add my own logo
